# Qopy

The fixed clipboard manager. The goal is simple be a alternative to the standart clipboard manager of windows. But it also supports Linux so you can also enjoy Qopy there. 

‚ùå macOS will probably be not supported if you want something similar on macOS take a look at [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) and their clipboard history extension.

For a list of how you can help me checkout the [issues section](https://github.com/0PandaDEV/Qopy/issues).

## üõ†Ô∏è Building for Production

```zsh
pnpm build
```

Don't worry, it will fail at the end because it can not detect a Private key, but the installer files will be generated regardless of that.

You can find them in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle`.
