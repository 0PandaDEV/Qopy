## üìã What is Qopy

Qopy is a fixed clipboard manager designed as a simple alternative to the standard clipboard in Windows. It aims to provide a smoother, more reliable experience. Plus, it's compatible with Linux, so you can enjoy the same great features on both operating systems.

‚ùå macOS will probably be not supported if you want something similar on macOS take a look at [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) and their clipboard history extension.

Or to get Qopy set up on your machine, you'll need to have Rust and pnpm installed. Then, follow these steps:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/0pandadev/Qopy.git
cd Qopy
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

> \[!TIP]

> If you are interested in contributing code, feel free to check out our GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/0pandadev/Qopy/issues).

## üî® Building for production

To build for production simply execute:

```zsh
pnpm build
```

> \[!NOTE]
>
> Don't worry, it will fail at the end because it can not detect a Private key, but the installer files will be generated regardless of that.
> 
> You can find them in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle`.
